# Notes

This directory contains the relevant code and (partial) data to replicate results found in the manuscript. Please see `README.txt` in the base directory for an explanation of how to obtain the full dataset.

Of note:
1. `code` contains all the code that includes `python` scripts for doing some basic manipulations and `R` markdown files for creating figures.
2. `figure_data` contains the *processed* data that can be used to make the figures according to the `R` markdown files.
3. `figure_output` contains the output from running the code on the relevant figure data. These are mostly sub-panels for the larger manuscript figures
4. `manuscript_figures` contains our final main text and supporting figures.
5. Lastly, as noted, this directory should ultimately contain `manuscript_results` (which must be obtained from zenodo). This (large) dataset contains the complete set of raw data that was ultimately parsed and trimmed down to create the processed data found in `figure_data`.
